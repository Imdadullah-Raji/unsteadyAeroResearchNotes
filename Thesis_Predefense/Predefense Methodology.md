  

Two kinds of numerical investigations were undertaken: steady airfoil at different angles of attack, pitching airfoil according to a prescribed rotational motion $\alpha(t)$. The finite-volume code OpenFOAM( specifically Foundation OpenFOAMv13) was used to set up both kinds of simulation.{Ref to original 1998 paper by Weller et al} .

## Static NACA0012 Airfoil

### Mesh

Both for the stationary and pitching airfoils the computational domain is a disk of radius $30c$. The mesh is discretized using transfinite interpolation, with all quadrilateral elements throughout. An overview and close up is provided in Fig < fig num>.

To keep the boundary layer sufficiently resolved the first cell height is taken as a function of the Reynolds number, $h1 = 0.05/\sqrt{\text{Re}}$, which is approximately the 1/100th of the Blasius boundary layer thickness for a flat plate.

For the steady cases, the angle of attack $\alpha$ is changed by rotating the freestream direction. For pitching cases the whole mesh is rotated rigidly around a pivot.

### Solver Setup

As the flow regime is laminar, the smallest relevant scale to resolve is the shear layer near the no-slip wall. The governing equations were solved directly, no turbulence models were employed.

## Time stepping  

The time step is fixed within each run; adaptive time stepping is disabled.

Each run has three phases:
1. **Start-up.** An impulsive start at $\Delta t = 4\times10^{-5}$ up to $t = 0.5$.
2. **Transient.** The step is chosen from the Courant number measured at the end
of start-up, capped at $\Delta t \le 6\times10^{-4}$. The run advances until the lift history reaches a limit cycle: over two consecutive windows, its mean, amplitude and frequency must agree to 1%.
3. **Snapshot record.** Twenty limit-cycle periods, with 32 snapshots per shedding period.
Production time steps were $\Delta t = 4.3$–$6.3\times10^{-4}$, and the maximum Courant number stayed below 0.8.

## Pitching NACA0012

### Airfoil Motion Using Arbitrary Langrangian Eulerian

The same mesh topology as the static case is reused for the pitching airfoil. The circular symmetry of the O-grid is exploited to implement pitching motion. The entire mesh rotates relative to the flow and the time derivatives in the moving mesh are converted to the stationary coordinate frame, a technique known as Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian(ALE).

  

$$ \left. \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \right|_\xi = \left. \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \right|_x + \sum_{i} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} \left. \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial t} \right|_\xi = \left. \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \right|_x +\mathbb{u_m}\cdot\nabla\phi$$

  

Here $\mathbb{u_m}$ is the mesh motion, in the rigid body rotation case this is given by

$$\mathbb{u_m} = \mathbb{\Omega}\times\mathbb{r}$$

For our 2D case $\mathbb{\Omega}(t) = \alpha(t)\hat{k}$ , where $\alpha(t)$ is a prescribed rotational dispplacement function.

This transformation changes the material derivative $D\mathbb{u}/Dt$ and hence the Navier Stokes momentum equation as follows.

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} +((u-u_m)\cdot\nabla)u = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2u$$
### Solver Setup

Each unsteady simulation is started from a converged

steady flow solution at $\alpha=0$, which is obtained using the steady state SIMPLE algorithm. Then the transient PIMPLE algorithm is used to calculate the time evolving pressure and velocity fields.  

For the pitch-up input function a continously differentiable approximation to unit step function is used.

$$

\alpha(t) = \Delta\alpha\, s^{3}\left(6s^{2} - 15s + 10\right), \qquad s = \min(t/T,\ 1)

$$

This $\alpha(t)$ has $\dot{\alpha}=\ddot{\alpha}=0$ at the beginning and at the end of the manuver, which avoids the singularity associated with the step function, ensuring numerical stability.
